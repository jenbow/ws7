This book of 600 pages is monumental in size and content. It covers all paintings and almost everything else Leonardo did in his lifetime, including what went lost. The author provides the meaning and the historical context of Leonardo's work, the publisher provides an outstanding outlet to showcase the immense work of Leonardo the painter, the engineer, the architect, the sculptor, the anatomist, the genius ahead of his time. The book is divided in three parts (each one a book in itself): Life and Work; the Complete Paintings; the Graphic Work. The book is beautiful to read and to watch and whatever  is the price, take it! It is worth every cent. You will not be able to stop to watch its brilliant paintings and drawings.

We then found a brand new copy for less than $A200, including freight, on Amazon. I was delighted and it arrived, as promised, ready to present to him on the morning of his birthday.

The modern preoccupation with quick sketches determines much of the layout--tiny thumbnail scribbles are blown up to fill entire pages, while exquisitely detailed drawings are reproduced quite small; as a result, one can't appreciate either as they were meant to be seen.  I had always wanted to see a complete collection of Leonardo's incredible drapery studies; this would've been an ideal place to show them at their best, but only a few are presented full size. Given the massiveness of the book, it would've been so logical to simply reproduce all of Leonardo's drawings at actual or near-actual size, but publishers often seem to go for flashy graphics instead of sensible presentations. An ambitious art director needed to make his mark on this product, and decided that his \\"vision\\" was more important than fidelity to the work of Leonardo da Vinci...what a shame...<br /><br />The paintings look wonderful, although--again--the hyper-magnified closeups are pointlessly extreme--a full page reproduction with several actual-sized closeups of each painting would've been ideal. Final complaint: only one version of Madonna of the Rocks was shown with details; for some reason they used the later one, which was painted by assistants, rather than the master's original work. Considering that this is probably Leonardo's most complex, fully-realized surviving painting, such an omission seems criminal!	2005-07-18

The very large, heavy tome sets out to explore the history of one of the greatest minds, artists, thinkers, and seers of all time and in doing so we are presented with all of the paintings down to the brushstroke, all of the drawings which include notes and paper quality, and the many writings of this giant of a man.  Frank Zollner is an entertaining writer as well as a fine scholar.  The facts are all (mostly) here and they are related in an enormously readable fashion.  No dry data crunching here, just elegant prose that accompanies more visuals than you could ever imagine.<br />The three parts of the book are presented with equal importance: Part One is Da Vinci's life and his place in the historic and retrospective setting and contains many of his writings.  Part Two is the catalogue raissone for the paintings, both those well known and extant and some images of paintings that no longer exist. Part Three is devoted to the fascinating drawings of just about every subject imaginable.  Each is presented with grace, a touch of humor, and a sense of profound respect.<br />Other books on Da Vinci may boast better/more correct color reproduction and choices of cropping and layout, but for the sheer splendor of this great artist's output and influence on the world of art, religion, sociology and science, this book is going to be the benchmark for years to come.  A magnificent book for your table and a particularly elegant gift for your friends!	2003-11-26

Leonardo Da Vinci epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. He possessed one of the greatest minds of all times. Painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, scientist, Da Vinci personified creative genius and had an immeasurable effect on modern culture. This compilation of his work, probably the most complete collection ever made, is spectacular. The reproductions are riveting.<br />Taschen has reproduced here Leonardo Da Vinci's 34 paintings in glorious color. The paper quality is excellent as is the binding. From &quot;The Last Supper&quot; to the &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; the paintings' details, even Da Vinci's brushstrokes, are clearly visible and exquisite. This 700 page book measures 22&quot; X 17&quot; when open and many of the artist's masterworks are shown with full page or double page details.<br />Frank Zollner biographical text is beautifully written and the book's first ten chapters explore Da Vinci's life, with excerpts from his letters, contracts and diaries. His painting are also discussed and interpreted here. A complete catalogue of Leonardo's paintings is included in Part II. Da Vinci's extraordinary talent as a draftsman is documented in the six hundred and sixty-three drawings which are presented in Part III. The drawings are arranged by categories, i.e., figures, anatomy, architecture, etc. Johannes Nathan's has written excellent commentary on Da Vinci's drawings and the artist's sensitive lines, both fine and bold, are truly a feast for the eyes.<br />&quot;Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings and Drawings&quot; is one of the most visually stunning books I have ever seen. This was a &quot;must have/must own&quot; item for me, and I have spent many leisurely hours reading, perusing and enjoying this phenomenal collection.

This is an excelent book which shoud be in any library of an art lover.
An amazingly beautiful book which we treasure and also give as presents. <br />Best way to enjoy is to leave it open on a table and flip pages daily. <br />It is the only art book which we have in our living room other than our <br />own publications on art and architecture.
This is the best book about Master Leonardo. All the information that you need to know, the magnificent reproductions of the paintings and drawings plus the over size prints of the mayor paints, give to any art student and art lover the best close up. The first time I saw it, I fell in love with it.....You most have it
This book of 600 pages is monumental in size and content. It covers all paintings and almost everything else Leonardo did in his lifetime, including what went lost. The author provides the meaning and the historical context of Leonardo's work, the publisher provides an outstanding outlet to showcase the immense work of Leonardo the painter, the engineer, the architect, the sculptor, the anatomist, the genius ahead of his time. The book is divided in three parts (each one a book in itself): Life and Work; the Complete Paintings; the Graphic Work. The book is beautiful to read and to watch and whatever  is the price, take it! It is worth every cent. You will not be able to stop to watch its brilliant paintings and drawings. Highly recommended.
We saw this amazing book in Venice for 150 Euros but it was too heavy to take home in the plane. My husband really loved it. So when we got home I decided to get it for his birthday. The local bookshop had it for $A435 -too expensive. We then found a brand new copy for less than $A200, including freight, on Amazon. I was delighted and it arrived, as promised, ready to present to him on the morning of his birthday. He was really surprised and has been pouring over it ever since. Great book, great price and great service.
A book of incredibly high quality, superbly strutcured and with extremely high quality photographs. The inclusion of \\"magnified\\" segments of works, showing the superb detail of th artist's finesse is particularly valuable to those who wish to see the techniques used in creating the work.  A real \\"must have\\", both for those who really wish to know more about art, and those who want a top class \\"coffee table\\" master-piece!
This is a beautiful book with great reproductions, probably worth buying, but I found some of the design choices frustrating and baffling. The modern preoccupation with quick sketches determines much of the layout--tiny thumbnail scribbles are blown up to fill entire pages, while exquisitely detailed drawings are reproduced quite small; as a result, one can't appreciate either as they were meant to be seen.  I had always wanted to see a complete collection of Leonardo's incredible drapery studies; this would've been an ideal place to show them at their best, but only a few are presented full size. Given the massiveness of the book, it would've been so logical to simply reproduce all of Leonardo's drawings at actual or near-actual size, but publishers often seem to go for flashy graphics instead of sensible presentations. An ambitious art director needed to make his mark on this product, and decided that his \\"vision\\" was more important than fidelity to the work of Leonardo da Vinci...what a shame...<br /><br />The paintings look wonderful, although--again--the hyper-magnified closeups are pointlessly extreme--a full page reproduction with several actual-sized closeups of each painting would've been ideal. Final complaint: only one version of Madonna of the Rocks was shown with details; for some reason they used the later one, which was painted by assistants, rather than the master's original work. Considering that this is probably Leonardo's most complex, fully-realized surviving painting, such an omission seems criminal!
It doesn't matter if you have other Leonardo books or not, I guarantee you that they can't compare to this volume. I first saw this at the Met Museum in NY and immediately knew it was a \\"must buy\\" book. The pictures are stunning and give you an unrivaled view of his work. No 0other Leonardo book even comes close.<br /><br />This book is huge(approx 18\\"H x 12\\"W x 3\\"D)which should tell you something. The pictures fill the pages and the close-up details are amazing too. Don't forget, this is complete, all drawings, paintings, studies, etc. It's fabulous!<br /><br />You won't be sorry, and at the price listed today (5/25/05) of $80 you'd be foolish to pass it by -I'm just jealous I paid so much more, but still think I got my money's worth.
I recently saw this book in a local bookstore and being a huge DaVinci \\"fan\\" I immediately wanted to buy it. But its price (over US $200) made it imposible. I have a budget like everybody else!<br /><br />I knew I could get a better deal in Amazon but I never thought it was going to be so good! Enough has been said about the amazing quality of \\"Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings and Drawings\\". I just want to add that you probably won't find a lower price so... buy it!
This work is a worthy testament to da Vinci's talents as a<br /><br />painter, sculptor, architect, scientist and inventor. Famous<br /><br />paintings; such as, the Annunciation are depicted in full color.<br /><br />Leonardo's life is set forth in a series of memorable letters,<br /><br />the personal diary and important scientific achievements. A<br /><br />beauty of the work is that considerable artistic criticism<br /><br />is provided by the authors. There are over 600 pages with<br /><br />many drawings and works of art depicted. This is a relatively<br /><br />modern work having been published in 2003. Considerable<br /><br />drawings depicting his inventions are set forth in formal<br /><br />engineering schematics-much in the detail of Buckminster Fuller's<br /><br />Geodome.<br /><br />This work would be perfect for any student project in art,<br /><br />world history, world culture and even mathematics/science.<br /><br />It is a solid acquisition for any personal/professional library.<br /><br />The price is considerable . The volume sells between $120-$200.<br /><br />This would be a perfect gift for almost any occasion.

LEONARDO DA VINCI: THE COMPLETE PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS is a mammoth undertaking in concept and the product of this undertaking is physically mammoth!  The very large, heavy tome sets out to explore the history of one of the greatest minds, artists, thinkers, and seers of all time and in doing so we are presented with all of the paintings down to the brushstroke, all of the drawings which include notes and paper quality, and the many writings of this giant of a man.  Frank Zollner is an entertaining writer as well as a fine scholar.  The facts are all (mostly) here and they are related in an enormously readable fashion.  No dry data crunching here, just elegant prose that accompanies more visuals than you could ever imagine.<br />The three parts of the book are presented with equal importance: Part One is Da Vinci's life and his place in the historic and retrospective setting and contains many of his writings.  Part Two is the catalogue raissone for the paintings, both those well known and extant and some images of paintings that no longer exist. Part Three is devoted to the fascinating drawings of just about every subject imaginable.  Each is presented with grace, a touch of humor, and a sense of profound respect.<br />Other books on Da Vinci may boast better/more correct color reproduction and choices of cropping and layout, but for the sheer splendor of this great artist's output and influence on the world of art, religion, sociology and science, this book is going to be the benchmark for years to come.  A magnificent book for your table and a particularly elegant gift for your friends!
Leonardo Da Vinci epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. He possessed one of the greatest minds of all times. Painter, sculptor, architect, engineer, scientist, Da Vinci personified creative genius and had an immeasurable effect on modern culture. This compilation of his work, probably the most complete collection ever made, is spectacular. The reproductions are riveting.<br />Taschen has reproduced here Leonardo Da Vinci's 34 paintings in glorious color. The paper quality is excellent as is the binding. From &quot;The Last Supper&quot; to the &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; the paintings' details, even Da Vinci's brushstrokes, are clearly visible and exquisite. This 700 page book measures 22&quot; X 17&quot; when open and many of the artist's masterworks are shown with full page or double page details.<br />Frank Zollner biographical text is beautifully written and the book's first ten chapters explore Da Vinci's life, with excerpts from his letters, contracts and diaries. His painting are also discussed and interpreted here. A complete catalogue of Leonardo's paintings is included in Part II. Da Vinci's extraordinary talent as a draftsman is documented in the six hundred and sixty-three drawings which are presented in Part III. The drawings are arranged by categories, i.e., figures, anatomy, architecture, etc. Johannes Nathan's has written excellent commentary on Da Vinci's drawings and the artist's sensitive lines, both fine and bold, are truly a feast for the eyes.<br />&quot;Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings and Drawings&quot; is one of the most visually stunning books I have ever seen. This was a &quot;must have/must own&quot; item for me, and I have spent many leisurely hours reading, perusing and enjoying this phenomenal collection. I can't think of a better gift for anyone who admires this master's works. This is a very rare and special book.<br />JANA
I was literally aghast when I opened this giant, lavish production to see page after page of the paintings bound right down the center and into the spine of the book.  I can't imagine what the publisher was thinking.  Tashen books are never really good books, but could they really exercise such poor judgement when using such a large amount of resources?<br />On the positive side, the drawings are excellently reproduced and are rarely split.  Fortunately, they constitute the vast majority of the book.  However, the book should be purchased for the drawings only.  The treatment of the paintings is offensive.  So much for a comprehensive source on Leonardo.  Hold on to those books on the paintings, when you buy this one!
Taschen has always done an amazing job on their high-end titles.  They have, however, out done themselves on Leonardo Da Vinci.  The book is huge, the binding and paper quality excellent.  It is the reproductions though that are the most riveting.  As mentioned in one of the above editorial reviews you can almost enter into the paintings, the detail is so close.  I have spent hours looking into the works and find new detail each time I do.  Highly recommended.
I love this book man.  It sings to my soul, man.  It's all about the love, and thats why I like it, like so much, man.

Leonardo Da Vinci epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal He possessed one of the greatest minds of all times Painter sculptor architect engineer scientist Da Vinci personified creative genius  had an immeasurable effect on modern culture This compilation of his work probably the most complete collection ever made is spectacular The reproductions are riveting Taschen has reproduced here Leonardo Da Vinci's 34 paintings  glorious color The paper quality is excellent as is the binding From  The Last Supper  to the  Mona Lisa  the paintings' details even Da Vinci's brushstrokes are clearly visible  exquisite This 700 page book measures 22  X 17  when open  many of the artist's masterworks are shown with full page  double page details Frank Zollner biographical text is beautifully written  the book's first ten chapters explore Da Vinci's life with excerpts from his letters contracts  diaries His painting are also discussed  interpreted here A complete catalogue of Leonardo's paintings is included  Part II Da Vinci's extraordinary talent as a draftsman is documented  the six hundred  sixty-three drawings which are presented  Part III The drawings are arranged by categories ie figures anatomy architecture etc Johannes Nathan's has written excellent commentary on Da Vinci's drawings  the artist's sensitive lines both fine  bold are truly a feast for the eyes  Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings  Drawings  is one of the most visually stunning books I have ever seen This was a  must have/must own  item for me  I have spent many leisurely hours reading perusing  enjoying this phenomenal collection I can't think of a better gift for anyone who admires this master's works This is a very rare  special book JANA
I was literally aghast when I opened this giant lavish production to see page after page of the paintings bound right down the center  into the spine of the book  I can't imagine what the publisher was thinking  Tashen books are never really good books but could they really exercise such poor judgement when using such a large amount of resources? On the positive side the drawings are excellently reproduced  are rarely split  Fortunately they constitute the vast majority of the book  However the book should be purchased for the drawings only  The treatment of the paintings is offensive  So much for a comprehensive source on Leonardo  Hold on to those books on the paintings when you buy this one!
Taschen has always done an amazing job on their high-end titles  They have however out done themselves on Leonardo Da Vinci  The book is huge the binding  paper quality excellent   is the reproductions though that are the most riveting  As mentioned  one of the above editorial reviews you can almost enter into the paintings the detail is so close  I have spent hours looking into the works  find new detail each time I do  Highly recommended
I love this book man   sings to my soul man  's all about the love  thats why I like  like so much man

This is an excelent book which shoud be  any library of an art lover
An amazingly beautiful book which we treasure  also give as presents  Best way to enjoy is to leave  open on a table  flip pages daily   is the only art book which we have  our living room other than our  own publications on art  architecture
This is the best book about Master Leonardo All the information that you need to know the magnificent reproductions of the paintings  drawings plus the over size prints of the mayor paints give to any art student  art lover the best close up The first time I saw  I fell  love with itYou most have 
This book of 600 pages is monumental  size  content  covers all paintings  almost everything else Leonardo did  his lifetime including what went lost The author provides the meaning  the historical context of Leonardo's work the publisher provides an outstanding outlet to showcase the immense work of Leonardo the painter the engineer the architect the sculptor the anatomist the genius ahead of his time The book is divided  three parts (each one a book  itself): Life  Work the Complete Paintings the Graphic Work The book is beautiful to read  to watch  whatever  is the price take !  is worth every cent You will not be able to stop to watch its brilliant paintings  drawings Highly recommended
We saw this amazing book  Venice for 150 Euros but  was too heavy to take home  the plane My husband really loved  So when we got home I decided to get  for his birthday The local bookshop had  for $A435 -too expensive We then found a brand new copy for less than $A200 including freight on Amazon I was delighted   arrived as promised ready to present to him on the morning of his birthday He was really surprised  has been pouring over  ever since Great book great price  great service
A book of incredibly high quality superbly strutcured  with extremely high quality photographs The inclusion of "magnified" segments of works showing the superb detail of th artist's finesse is particularly valuable to those who wish to see the techniques used  creating the work  A real "must have" both for those who really wish to know more about art  those who want a top class "coffee table" master-piece!
This is a beautiful book with great reproductions probably worth buying but I found some of the design choices frustrating  baffling The modern preoccupation with quick sketches determines much of the layout--tiny thumbnail scribbles are blown up to fill entire pages while exquisitely detailed drawings are reproduced quite small as a result one can't appreciate either as they were meant to be seen  I had always wanted to see a complete collection of Leonardo's incredible drapery studies this would've been an ideal place to show them at their best but only a few are presented full size Given the massiveness of the book  would've been so logical to simply reproduce all of Leonardo's drawings at actual  near-actual size but publishers often seem to go for flashy graphics instead of sensible presentations An ambitious art director needed to make his mark on this product  decided that his "vision" was more important than fidelity to the work of Leonardo da Vinciwhat a shame  The paintings look wonderful although--again--the hyper-magnified closeups are pointlessly extreme--a full page reproduction with several actual-sized closeups of each painting would've been ideal Final complaint: only one version of Madonna of the Rocks was shown with details for some reason they used the later one which was painted by assistants rather than the master's original work Considering that this is probably Leonardo's most complex fully-realized surviving painting such an omission seems criminal!
 doesn't matter  you have other Leonardo books  not I guarantee you that they can't compare to this volume I first saw this at the Met Museum  NY  immediately knew  was a "must buy" book The pictures are stunning  give you an unrivaled view of his work No 0other Leonardo book even comes close  This book is huge(approx 18"H x 12"W x 3"D)which should tell you something The pictures fill the pages  the close-up details are amazing too Don't forget this is complete all drawings paintings studies etc 's fabulous!  You won't be sorry  at the price listed today (5/25/05) of $80 you'd be foolish to pass  by -I'm just jealous I paid so much more but still think I got my money's worth
I recently saw this book  a local bookstore  being a huge DaVinci "fan" I immediately wanted to buy  But its price (over US $200) made  imposible I have a budget like everybody else!  I knew I could get a better deal  Amazon but I never thought  was going to be so good! Enough has been said about the amazing quality of "Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings  Drawings" I just want to add that you probably won't find a lower price so buy !
This work is a worthy testament to da Vinci's talents as a  painter sculptor architect scientist  inventor Famous  paintings such as the Annunciation are depicted  full color  Leonardo's life is set forth  a series of memorable letters  the personal diary  important scientific achievements A  beauty of the work is that considerable artistic criticism  is provided by the authors There are over 600 pages with  many drawings  works of art depicted This is a relatively  modern work having been published  2003 Considerable  drawings depicting his inventions are set forth  formal  engineering schematics-much  the detail of Buckminster Fuller's  Geodome  This work would be perfect for any student project  art  world history world culture  even mathematics/science   is a solid acquisition for any personal/professional library  The price is considerable  The volume sells between $120-$200  This would be a perfect gift for almost any occasion
Not much more to add to what's already been said  This is a big investment of space as well as money but I'm glad I have  I've never seen an art book that compares for Leonardo  any artist for that matter  Absolutely beautiful

Taschen has always done an amazing job on their high-end titles  They have however out done themselves on Leonardo Da Vinci  The book is huge the binding  paper quality excellent   is the reproductions though that are the most riveting  As mentioned  one of the above editorial reviews you can almost enter into the paintings the detail is so close  I have spent hours looking into the works  find new detail each time I do  Highly recommended
I love this book man   sings to my soul man  's all about the love  thats why I like  like so much man

This is an excelent book which shoud be any library of an art lover
An amazingly beautiful book which we treasure also give as presents Best way to enjoy is to leave open on a table flip pages daily is the only art book which we have our living room other than our own publications on art architecture
This is the best book about Master Leonardo All the information that you need to know the magnificent reproductions of the paintings drawings plus the over size prints of the mayor paints give to any art student art lover the best close up The first time I saw I fell love with itYou most have 
This book of 600 pages is monumental size content covers all paintings almost everything else Leonardo did his lifetime including what went lost The author provides the meaning the historical context of Leonardo's work the publisher provides an outstanding outlet to showcase the immense work of Leonardo the painter the engineer the architect the sculptor the anatomist the genius ahead of his time The book is divided three parts (each one a book itself): Life Work the Complete Paintings the Graphic Work The book is beautiful to read to watch whatever is the price take ! is worth every cent You will not be able to stop to watch its brilliant paintings drawings Highly recommended
We saw this amazing book Venice for 150 Euros but was too heavy to take home the plane My husband really loved So when we got home I decided to get for his birthday The local bookshop had for $A435 -too expensive We then found a brand new copy for less than $A200 including freight on Amazon I was delighted arrived as promised ready to present to him on the morning of his birthday He was really surprised has been pouring over ever since Great book great price great service
A book of incredibly high quality superbly strutcured with extremely high quality photographs The inclusion of "magnified" segments of works showing the superb detail of th artist's finesse is particularly valuable to those who wish to see the techniques used creating the work A real "must have" both for those who really wish to know more about art those who want a top class "coffee table" master-piece!
This is a beautiful book with great reproductions probably worth buying but I found some of the design choices frustrating baffling The modern preoccupation with quick sketches determines much of the layout--tiny thumbnail scribbles are blown up to fill entire pages while exquisitely detailed drawings are reproduced quite small as a result one can't appreciate either as they were meant to be seen I had always wanted to see a complete collection of Leonardo's incredible drapery studies this would've been an ideal place to show them at their best but only a few are presented full size Given the massiveness of the book would've been so logical to simply reproduce all of Leonardo's drawings at actual near-actual size but publishers often seem to go for flashy graphics instead of sensible presentations An ambitious art director needed to make his mark on this product decided that his "vision" was more important than fidelity to the work of Leonardo da Vinciwhat a shame The paintings look wonderful although--again--the hyper-magnified closeups are pointlessly extreme--a full page reproduction with several actual-sized closeups of each painting would've been ideal Final complaint: only one version of Madonna of the Rocks was shown with details for some reason they used the later one which was painted by assistants rather than the master's original work Considering that this is probably Leonardo's most complex fully-realized surviving painting such an omission seems criminal!
 doesn't matter you have other Leonardo books not I guarantee you that they can't compare to this volume I first saw this at the Met Museum NY immediately knew was a "must buy" book The pictures are stunning give you an unrivaled view of his work No 0other Leonardo book even comes close This book is huge(approx 18"H x 12"W x 3"D)which should tell you something The pictures fill the pages the close-up details are amazing too Don't forget this is complete all drawings paintings studies etc 's fabulous! You won't be sorry at the price listed today (5/25/05) of $80 you'd be foolish to pass by -I'm just jealous I paid so much more but still think I got my money's worth
I recently saw this book a local bookstore being a huge DaVinci "fan" I immediately wanted to buy But its price (over US $200) made imposible I have a budget like everybody else! I knew I could get a better deal Amazon but I never thought was going to be so good! Enough has been said about the amazing quality of "Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings Drawings" I just want to add that you probably won't find a lower price so buy !
This work is a worthy testament to da Vinci's talents as a painter sculptor architect scientist inventor Famous paintings such as the Annunciation are depicted full color Leonardo's life is set forth a series of memorable letters the personal diary important scientific achievements A beauty of the work is that considerable artistic criticism is provided by the authors There are over 600 pages with many drawings works of art depicted This is a relatively modern work having been published 2003 Considerable drawings depicting his inventions are set forth formal engineering schematics-much the detail of Buckminster Fuller's Geodome This work would be perfect for any student project art world history world culture even mathematics/science is a solid acquisition for any personal/professional library The price is considerable The volume sells between $120-$200 This would be a perfect gift for almost any occasion
Not much more to add to what's already been said This is a big investment of space as well as money but I'm glad I have I've never seen an art book that compares for Leonardo any artist for that matter Absolutely beautiful
LEONARDO DA VINCI: THE COMPLETE PAINTINGS AND DRAWINGS is a mammoth undertaking concept the product of this undertaking is physically mammoth! The very large heavy tome sets out to explore the history of one of the greatest minds artists thinkers seers of all time doing so we are presented with all of the paintings down to the brushstroke all of the drawings which include notes paper quality the many writings of this giant of a man Frank Zollner is an entertaining writer as well as a fine scholar The facts are all (mostly) here they are related an enormously readable fashion No dry data crunching here just elegant prose that accompanies more visuals than you could ever imagine The three parts of the book are presented with equal importance: Part One is Da Vinci's life his place the historic retrospective setting contains many of his writings Part Two is the catalogue raissone for the paintings both those well known extant some images of paintings that no longer exist Part Three is devoted to the fascinating drawings of just about every subject imaginable Each is presented with grace a touch of humor a sense of profound respect Other books on Da Vinci may boast better/more correct color reproduction choices of cropping layout but for the sheer splendor of this great artist's output influence on the world of art religion sociology science this book is going to be the benchmark for years to come A magnificent book for your table a particularly elegant gift for your friends!
Leonardo Da Vinci epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal He possessed one of the greatest minds of all times Painter sculptor architect engineer scientist Da Vinci personified creative genius had an immeasurable effect on modern culture This compilation of his work probably the most complete collection ever made is spectacular The reproductions are riveting Taschen has reproduced here Leonardo Da Vinci's 34 paintings glorious color The paper quality is excellent as is the binding From The Last Supper to the Mona Lisa the paintings' details even Da Vinci's brushstrokes are clearly visible exquisite This 700 page book measures 22 X 17 when open many of the artist's masterworks are shown with full page double page details Frank Zollner biographical text is beautifully written the book's first ten chapters explore Da Vinci's life with excerpts from his letters contracts diaries His painting are also discussed interpreted here A complete catalogue of Leonardo's paintings is included Part II Da Vinci's extraordinary talent as a draftsman is documented the six hundred sixty-three drawings which are presented Part III The drawings are arranged by categories ie figures anatomy architecture etc Johannes Nathan's has written excellent commentary on Da Vinci's drawings the artist's sensitive lines both fine bold are truly a feast for the eyes Leonardo Da Vinci: The Complete Paintings Drawings is one of the most visually stunning books I have ever seen This was a must have/must own item for me I have spent many leisurely hours reading perusing enjoying this phenomenal collection I can't think of a better gift for anyone who admires this master's works This is a very rare special book JANA
